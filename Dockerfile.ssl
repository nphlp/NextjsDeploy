# SSL Certificate Manager Dockerfile
#
# This container generates SSL certificates for MySQL connections before the app starts.
#
# Objective:
#   -> Use `/scripts/ssl-certs.sh` to generate SSL certificates into `certs/` directory
#   -> Share `certs/` directory with `nextjs` and `mysql` containers
# 
# Problem:
#   -> Use shared volumes for `certs/` is only possible at `runtime`
#   -> Import `scripts/` at `runtime` is not possible because:
#      1. Portainer CE doesn't support relative path mapping for volumes with local cloned Git repositories
#      2. Portainer clones Github repositories into deep volume paths like:
#      /var/lib/docker/volumes/{portainer_stack_name}_{portainer_volume_data}/_data/compose/{project_stack_id}/
#
# Solution:
#   -> Copy the `scripts/` directory during `build time`
#   -> Generate SSL `certs/` at `runtime` when shared volumes are mounted
